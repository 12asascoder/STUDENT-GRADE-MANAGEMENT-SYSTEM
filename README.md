Student Grade Management:
A school/College needs a system to manage student grades.
• Create a class names ‘Student’ with attributes: studentID, name, and marks (array) for
storing marks of 5 subjects.
• Implement a function calculateAverage() to return the student's average marks.
• Implement another function displayDetails() to show the student’s details along with their
average marks.
Demonstrate how multiple student objects can be created and their details are displayed.
